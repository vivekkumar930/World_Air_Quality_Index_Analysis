## About Dataset


The goal of this dataset is to provide valuable insights into the air quality of different regions, allowing researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions on how to address the issue of air pollution.
This dataset is a merger of two separate datasets, one containing information about cities and their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates, and the other containing data on air pollution levels in countries across the world. By combining these two datasets, we can now analyze and compare air quality indices across different cities in various countries.
The inspiration for creating this dataset came from the growing concern over the impact of air pollution on our health and the environment. By making this data easily accessible and understandable, I hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve air quality and create a cleaner, healthier world for future generations.

## Explanation of common AQI terms


PM2.5: PM2.5 refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2.5 micrometers or less in width. They can be harmful to human health when inhaled, especially in high concentrations.

Ozone: Ozone is a gas that can form in the atmosphere through a chemical reaction between sunlight and other pollutants. High levels of ozone can be harmful to human health, particularly for those with respiratory issues.

Carbon Monoxide (CO): CO is a colorless, odorless gas that is produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels. High levels of CO can be toxic to humans and can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): SO2 is a gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels, particularly in industrial processes. It can have harmful effects on human health, leading to respiratory issues and exacerbating asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): NO2 is a gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels, primarily in vehicles and power plants. Exposure to high levels of NO2 can irritate the respiratory system and contribute to the development of respiratory conditions.

Air Quality Index (AQI): AQI is a measure used to communicate the level of air pollution in a specific area. It is often calculated based on the concentrations of various pollutants, such as PM2.5, ozone, CO, SO2, and NO2. The AQI provides a standardized scale to help individuals understand the air quality and take necessary precautions to protect their health.

Good: The "Good" category on the AQI scale indicates that the air quality is satisfactory, and there is little to no health risk associated with it.

Moderate: The "Moderate" category signifies that the air quality is acceptable, but there may be a moderate health concern for a small number of individuals, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups: This category indicates that the air quality is of concern for individuals who are more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, such as children, older adults, and people with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.

Unhealthy: The "Unhealthy" category suggests that the general population may start to experience health effects due to the poor air quality. It is advisable to limit outdoor activities and take necessary precautions.

Very Unhealthy: The "Very Unhealthy" category signifies a significant health risk from the air pollution. It is recommended to avoid outdoor activities and minimize exposure to the polluted air.

Hazardous: The "Hazardous" category indicates the highest level of air pollution, posing a severe health risk. It is crucial to stay indoors, use air filtration systems, and follow local authorities' guidance to protect health.
